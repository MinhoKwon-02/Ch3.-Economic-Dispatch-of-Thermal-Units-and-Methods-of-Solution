# Economic Dispatch of Thermal Units

This repository documents my structured study of
economic dispatch (ED) in power systems,
focusing on physical intuition and optimization logic.

## What I studied
- Generator input–output characteristics
- Incremental cost and heat rate
- Lagrangian formulation of economic dispatch
- KKT conditions with min/max constraints

## Why this matters
Economic dispatch explains how power systems
minimize operating cost while satisfying load balance
and generator constraints.
